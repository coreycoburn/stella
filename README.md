# Stella
## Web Application CLI Scaffolding tool for the Full Stack.

This is an opinionated rapid CLI installer for a few of the more popular web frameworks for both the front-end and back-end.

Have you ever started up a new project from the cli `npx create-react-app foo`, `vue create bar`, `laravel new baz`, then trying to integrate all of your additional files/packages for your project?

Examples:
- Adding your dotfiles (.eslintrc.js, .prettierrc.js, .editorconfig)
- Adding your project dependencies you include on every project (prop-types, memobind, styled-components, lodash, moment)
- Customizing your build scripts (i.e. customized linter or test runner script)
- Adding build hooks to your project (i.e. husky)
- Automatically setting up your project with tools such as Tailwind CSS along with PostCSS

## Why the name Stella?
Stella is the Italian word for **star**. Us developers say the word **star** when we are referring to the asterisk symbol. The */asterisk/star represents a wildcard/all character in many programming languages. Hence, you are able to use this CLI project to install several application frameworks with one interface.
